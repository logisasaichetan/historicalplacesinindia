        <h3 style="text-align: center"><u>TAJ MAHAL</u></h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The Taj Mahal is one of the most iconic and beautiful buildings in
          the world, and for good reason. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site
          and one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The Taj Mahal was built
          by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz
          Mahal, who died in 1631. It took 22 years to complete and is made of
          white marble and inlaid with semi-precious stones.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          There are many reasons why you should visit the Taj Mahal. Here are
          a few of the most compelling:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The architecture is breathtaking. The white marble is inlaid with
            semi-precious stones, and the symmetry and proportions of the
            building are simply stunning.
          </li>
          <li>
            The history is fascinating. The Taj Mahal is a testament to the
            love between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. It is also a reminder of
            the Mughal Empire, one of the most powerful dynasties in Indian
            history.
          </li>
          <li>
            The setting is beautiful. The Taj Mahal is located on the banks of
            the Yamuna River in Agra, India. The river, the gardens, and the
            surrounding buildings create a stunning backdrop for the Taj
            Mahal.
          </li>
          <li>
            The experience is unforgettable. Seeing the Taj Mahal in person is
            an unforgettable experience. The beauty of the building, the
            history, and the setting all combine to create a truly magical
            experience.
          </li>

        <p class="text-justify">
          The Red Fort (Lal Qila) is a historic fort in the Old Delhi
          neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that historically served as the main
          residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned
          construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to
          shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its
          design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also
          constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal
          architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace
          architecture with Indian traditions. The Red Fort is a massive
          complex of buildings, including palaces, mosques, gardens, and
          hammams (bathhouses). The most famous structures in the fort are the
          Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audience), the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of
          Private Audience), and the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque). The fort is
          surrounded by high walls and a moat.

        <p class="text-justify"></p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The Qutub Minar is a 72.5-meter (238 ft) tall, five-story, tapering
          minaret located in the Mehrauli area of Delhi, India. It is the
          tallest minaret in India and one of the tallest brick minaret in the
          world. The Qutub Minar was built by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the first
          Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1193. It was later extended by his
          successors, Iltutmish and Firoz Shah Tughlaq. The Qutub Minar is a
          UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the most popular tourist
          attractions in Delhi. It is a symbol of the Delhi Sultanate and of
          the Islamic rule in India. The minaret is made of red sandstone and
          is decorated with inscriptions from the Quran. It is tapered from a
          base diameter of 14.3 meters (47 ft) to a top diameter of 2.7 meters
          (9 ft). The minaret has five stories, each of which is smaller than
          the one below it. The top story is crowned by a chhatri, or dome.

        <p class="text-justify">
          The Hawa Mahal, also known as the Palace of the Winds, is a
          five-story palace located in Jaipur, India. It was built in 1799 by
          Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the ruler of Jaipur at the time. The
          palace is made of red and pink sandstone and is decorated with
          intricate latticework. It is located on the edge of the City Palace
          complex and overlooks the Hawa Mahal Road. The Hawa Mahal was built
          as a place for the royal women to observe the street below without
          being seen. The latticework on the walls allows for plenty of
          ventilation, which was important in the hot climate of Jaipur. The
          palace also has a number of small balconies, which the women could
          use to watch the street below. The Hawa Mahal is a popular tourist
          destination and is one of the most iconic landmarks in Jaipur. It is
          a beautiful example of Rajput architecture and is a reminder of the
          rich history of the city.
